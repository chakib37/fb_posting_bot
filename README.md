# fb_posting_bot

YOU'LL NEED TO DOWNLOAD CHROME DRIVER BECAUSE IT USES SELENIUM.

This is my first python project since I wanted to learn by making stuff so that i Don't get caught up in basic.

basically all this project does is take posts/memes from reddit and post them to facebook, you can edit the subreddits in the file called 'source'.
you can see if any problems happened in your path in the path file.

Update :
it now also mocks people in messenger,unless stopped using the command 'bela3'.
it can search the web with the command 'search' and send the first image from google.
it can send a meme/text from the subreddits in messener using the command 'memebot'.
Update :
it gets quotes from quotes.net and posts them

this might be useful if you want to keep a page working or a keep a group from dying or something, I don't know.
or piss off people because why not.
or just keep it for search or send memes in a groupchat.

for now, this project can not deal with videos/gifs, only pictures and text or both.

it will ask for your email and password only for the first time you use it, then generate a file to login by cookies (as it didn't even close the browser).
you can edit memebot.py to and change headless to false incase you wanted to see it working.
I'll try to get it to do more though.
